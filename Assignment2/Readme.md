In this application, we explore a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. Our goal was to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of this analysis, we provide clear recommendations to a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

The analysis was done in 4 steps

(1) Business Understanding 

(2) Data Understanding 

(3) Data Cleanup & Preparation 

(4) Modeling 

(5) Proposal to the customers

Final outcome of the process is - Lasso Regression fits well with the optimized data as it offers lowest RMSE values
