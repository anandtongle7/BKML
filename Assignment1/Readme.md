This directory contains project which aims at determining if the customer will select coupon offered or not using data analysis & visualization 

The directory contains following info: 

(1) Data : A csv formatted data is taken from UCI machine learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people 
whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. Answers given that the users will drive there "right away" or "later before the coupon expires" 
are labeled as "Y = 1", and answers "no, I do not want the coupon" are labeled as "Y = 0". There are five different types of couponsâ€”less 
expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20-$50)

(2) Jupyter file : prompt.ipynb (link : https://github.com/anandtongle7/BKML/blob/main/Assignment1/prompt.ipynb)

       #3# Rate is almost 1/2 if the driver is accompanying the kids 
       #4# Less than 1/2 if we know that the drivers have been visiting resturants less than 4 times a month & has income less than 50K

  (2) Coffee Coupon acceptance rates are high in
